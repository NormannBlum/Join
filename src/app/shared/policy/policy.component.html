  <p>
    Per Art. 4 No. 1 of Regulation (EU) 2016/679, i.e. the General Data
    Protection Regulation (hereinafter referred to as the „GDPR“), „processing“
    refers to any operation or set of operations such as collection, recording,

    making available, alignment, or combination, restriction, erasure, or
    destruction performed on personal data, whether by automated means or not.
  </p>
  <p>
    The following privacy policy is intended to inform you in particular about
    the type, scope, purpose, duration, and legal basis for the processing of
    such data either under our own control or in conjunction with others. We
    also inform you below about the third-party components we use to optimize
    our website and improve the user experience which may result in said third
    parties also processing data they collect and control.
  </p>
  <br />
  <p>Our privacy policy is structured as follows:</p>
  <p>
    I. Information about us as controllers of your data<br />II. The rights of
    users and data subjects<br />III. Information about the data processing
  </p>
  <br />
  <h3>I. Information about us as controllers of your data</h3>
  <p>
    The party responsible for this website (the „controller“) for purposes of
    data protection law is:
  </p>
  <p>
    Normann Blum<br />
    Eduard-Lucas-Str. 59<br />
    45131 Essen<br />

  <h3>II. The rights of users and data subjects</h3>
  <p>
    With regard to the data processing to be described in more detail below,
    users and data subjects have the right
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      to confirmation of whether data concerning them is being processed,
      information about the data being processed, further information about the
      nature of the data processing, and copies of the data (cf. also Art. 15
      GDPR);
    </li>
    <li>
      to correct or complete incorrect or incomplete data (cf. also Art. 16
      GDPR);
    </li>
    <li>
      to the immediate deletion of data concerning them (cf. also
      <a
        href="https://dejure.org/gesetze/DSGVO/17.html"
        title='Art. 17 DSGVO: Recht auf Löschung ("Recht auf Vergessenwerden")'
        rel="nofollow noopener"
        target="_blank"
        >Art. 17 DSGVO</a
      >), or, alternatively, if further processing is necessary as stipulated in
      Art. 17 Para. 3 GDPR, to restrict said processing per Art. 18 GDPR;
    </li>
    <li>
      to receive copies of the data concerning them and/or provided by them and
      to have the same transmitted to other providers/controllers (cf. also Art.
      20 GDPR);
    </li>
    <li>
      to file complaints with the supervisory authority if they believe that
      data concerning them is being processed by the controller in breach of
      data protection provisions (see also Art. 77 GDPR).
    </li>
  </ul><br />
  <p>
    In addition, the controller is obliged to inform all recipients to whom it
    discloses data of any such corrections, deletions, or restrictions placed on
    processing the same per Art. 16, 17 Para. 1, 18 GDPR. However, this
    obligation does not apply if such notification is impossible or involves a
    disproportionate effort. Nevertheless, users have a right to information
    about these recipients.
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong
      >Likewise, under Art. 21 GDPR, users and data subjects have the right to
      object to the controller’s future processing of their data pursuant to
      Art. 6 Para. 1 lit. f) GDPR. In particular, an objection to data
      processing for the purpose of direct advertising is permissible.</strong

  <h3>III. Information about the data processing</h3>
  <p>
    Your data processed when using our website will be deleted or blocked as
    soon as the purpose for its storage ceases to apply, provided the deletion
    of the same is not in breach of any statutory storage obligations or unless
    otherwise stipulated below.
  </p><br />
  <h4>
    Customer account/registration
  </h4>
  <p>
    If you create a customer account with us via our website, we will use the
    data you entered during registration (e.g. your name, your address, or your
    email address) exclusively for services leading up to your potential
    placement of an order or entering some other contractual relationship with
    us, to fulfill such orders or contracts, and to provide customer care (e.g.
    to provide you with an overview of your previous orders or to be able to
    offer you a wishlist function). We also store your IP address and the date
    and time of your registration. This data will not be transferred to third
    parties.
  </p>
  <p>
    During the registration process, your consent will be obtained for this
    processing of your data, with reference made to this privacy policy. The
    data collected by us will be used exclusively to provide your customer
    account.
  </p>
  <p>
    If you give your consent to this processing, Art. 6 Para. 1 lit. a) GDPR is
    the legal basis for this processing.
  </p>
  <p>
    If the opening of the customer account is also intended to lead to the
    initiation of a contractual relationship with us or to fulfill an existing
    contract with us, the legal basis for this processing is also Art. 6 Para. 1
    lit. b) GDPR.
  </p>
  <p>
    You may revoke your prior consent to the processing of your personal data at
    any time under Art. 7 Para. 3 GDPR with future effect. All you have to do is
    inform us that you are revoking your consent.
  </p>
  <p>
    The data previously collected will then be deleted as soon as processing is
    no longer necessary. However, we must observe any retention periods required
    under tax and commercial law.
  </p><br />
  <h4>Server data</h4>
  <p>
    For technical reasons, the following data sent by your internet browser to
    us or to our server provider will be collected, especially to ensure a
    secure and stable website: These server log files record the type and
    version of your browser, operating system, the website from which you came
    (referrer URL), the webpages on our site visited, the date and time of your
    visit, as well as the IP address from which you visited our site.
  </p>
  <p>
    The data thus collected will be temporarily stored, but not in association
    with any other of your data.
  </p>
  <p>
    The basis for this storage is Art. 6 Para. 1 lit. f) GDPR. Our legitimate
    interest lies in the improvement, stability, functionality, and security of
    our website.
  </p>
  <p>
    The data will be deleted within no more than seven days, unless continued
    storage is required for evidentiary purposes. In which case, all or part of
    the data will be excluded from deletion until the investigation of the
    relevant incident is finally resolved.
